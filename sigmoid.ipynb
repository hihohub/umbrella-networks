        "- Organize your image files into folders by category. For an ensemble of single-taskers, traditionally, only one level of folders is used. However, multiple levels are also possible, where an ensemble of single-taskers is formed for each level. For example, (book covers) -> (scifi), (fantasy), (mystery) would traditionally be (scifi book covers), (fantasy book covers), (mystery book covers).\n",

        "- Change the folder name in the demonstration code to your folder path.\n",
        "- The rest of the code should work as written.\n",
        "- Set 'levels' to anywhere from 1 to the number of layers in your folder structure. If levels=1, images from lower level folders are compressed into the outer level folders. If levels > 1, umbrella networks are formed recursively, one for each outer folder and each subfolder within the outer folders, up to the specified number of levels. The inner folders do not each require the same number of levels, but must have at least as many levels as the value specified for 'levels'."
